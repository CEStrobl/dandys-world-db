I wathced some ai videos. here is what I learned. I want you to emulate these in your design.


This video shows an easy two-step process to improve UI designs by adding depth:

Use shades of the same color for layering: Create 3-4 shades of a base color (e.g., by increasing lightness value by 0.1) and layer them to create a sense of depth and hierarchy between elements (0:07, 1:02, 5:58). Lighter shades typically indicate elements "on top" or more interactive.
Apply shadows strategically: Add small, soft shadows (combining light borders/glows on top with dark shadows at the bottom) to create a realistic, elevated feel for elements (0:29, 1:04). You can vary shadow size and intensity to show different levels of depth or importance (0:47, 4:59). Inset shadows can be used to make elements appear "pushed in" or deeper (5:12, 6:45).
The main idea is to use color layering and shadows to "raise or lower certain elements" (5:10) and give the impression of light hitting the UI, making it more dynamic and less "boring" (2:58).

This video explains a systematic approach to picking UI colors, focusing on the HSL color format for intuitive shade creation and dark/light mode implementation.

Key Concepts and Steps:

Color Types: Use neutral colors (background, text, borders), a brand/primary color (main actions), and semantic colors (states).
HSL Color Format: Preferred over Hex/RGB for creating palettes due to intuitive Hue, Saturation, and Lightness values (0-360, 0-100, 0-100 respectively). (0:48)
Neutral Palette (Dark Mode):
Set Saturation to 0 (neutral colors). Hue becomes irrelevant.
Use Lightness values (e.g., 0%, 5%, 10%) for base, surface, and highlighted elements. (1:47)
For text, use a higher contrast lightness for headings and a slightly muted shade for body text (e.g., not 100% lightness). (2:20)
Light Mode Adaptation:
Start by subtracting dark mode Lightness values from 100. (2:39)
Adjust manually for visual appeal. Reverse the lightness logic for backgrounds (darkest for base, lightest for top elements). (2:43)
Name colors logically (e.g., BG-dark, BG-light) rather than by mode. (2:57)
Adding Visual Depth (CSS Properties):
Borders: Visible but not distracting. (5:33)
Gradients: Use background colors for subtle gradients, possibly revealed on hover. (5:38)
Highlight: A lighter color for top borders to simulate light source. (5:51)
Shadows: Use transparency (alpha value 0-1). Mix darker/shorter with lighter/longer shadows for realism. (6:40)
Introducing OKLCH: A newer, more natural color format (Lightness, Chroma, Hue). Chroma is similar to saturation but goes from 0 to about 0.2 for UI. (7:39) Tailwind v4 uses OKLCH by default.
Implementation: Define color variables in CSS (root for default, body for alternative theme) and use JavaScript or media queries to toggle theme
